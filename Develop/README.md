# Professional Readme Generator
  

  ## Description
  This is a command-line application designed to streamline the process of creating professional and comprehensive README.md files for your projects. Instead of manually writing each section, this generator prompts you for key information about your project, such as the title, description, installation instructions, usage, license, contributing guidelines, and test instructions. It then dynamically generates a well-structured and formatted README file, including a Table of Contents, a license badge, and links to your GitHub profile and email address. This saves you time and ensures consistency and completeness in your project documentation.

  ## Table of Contents
  * [Installation](#installation)
  * [Usage](#usage)
  * [Contributing](#contributing)
  * [Tests](#tests)
  * [Questions](#questions)
