# Professional README Generator

## Description

This is a command-line application designed to streamline the process of creating professional and comprehensive README.md files for your projects. Instead of manually writing each section, this generator prompts you for key information about your project, such as the title, description, installation instructions, usage, license, contributing guidelines, and test instructions. It then dynamically generates a well-structured and formatted README file, including a Table of Contents, a license badge, and links to your GitHub profile and email address. This saves you time and ensures consistency and completeness in your project documentation.

## Table of Contents

* [Installation](#installation)
* [Usage](#usage)
* [License](#license)
* [Contributing](#contributing)
* [Tests](#tests)
* [Questions](#questions)

## Installation

To install the necessary dependencies for this application, clone the repository and run the following command in your terminal within the project directory:

```bash
npm install
```

This will install the `inquirer` package, which is used for prompting the user for input.

## Usage

To use the Professional README Generator, navigate to the project directory in your terminal and run the following command:

```bash
node index.js
```

You will be prompted with a series of questions about your project. Answer each question to provide the necessary information for your README. Once you have answered all the questions, a `README.md` file will be generated in the root of the project directory, containing the information you provided.
